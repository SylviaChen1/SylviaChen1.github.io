## Industry experience using C++ and Python
Excel+SQL+Python
I worked as a data analyst at Samsung and Lenovo China, mainly responsible for Data analysis and report writing. The types of data I analyze mainly include: home appliance online business data (Samsung), and Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) Logistics Operations date (Lenovo). The main analysis tool used at that time was Excel+SQL+Python. For enterprise data analysis, especially supply chain data presentation, we mainly use Microsoft Power BI.

Python + C + HPC
During my Ph.D. period, I used Python and C for model solving and Python for data analysis. I also use python to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. 

In my graduation thesis, I compared the computational efficiency and quality of algorithms written in python and C. The code written in C is more efficient, for some specific scenarios, the calculation speed and result quality are higher than commercial software GUROBI. My Python and C language skills can fully support further scientific research. 

## Code repositories
Tracking tools - I use GIT + Latex for all code and latex tracking. 

## Supply Chain Management Related Software
HPC - I am proficient in high performance computing (HPC) process data and perform complex calculations.
ERP - I used SAP as the ERP management tool when I was working at Samsung. 
Project management - Use Jira as internal team project management tools. 
CRM + real-time data analysis tools - Dynamics 365 + Power BI (University of Newcastle)
Drawing – Viso, Matplotlib
Vensim - developing, analyzing, and packaging dynamic feedback models















Whenever I run into a technical problem, my first instinct is to open up a new tab and google the issue. In my experience over the years, I’ve learned that knowing how to phrase your question is half the battle. If you’re unable to the problem you're facing into words, it’s difficult to receive answers and find the help you’re looking for. Of course, it’s important to remember that people ask questions because they may be unfamiliar with a topic and are seeking advice from those who have more experience. There may not be stupid questions, but there is definitely a less optimal way to format questions. As a software engineer, forums and articles are the holy-grail in connecting with other developers to share bugs and receive constructive feedback. In order to maximize the help you receive from others, one must learn how to pose questions in an intelligent manner.


## Understanding the Wrong Way to Ask Questions

Asking for help on a public forum can lead developers to become sloppy and write poorly phrased questions with very little to no background information. Rather than spend time to understand where the problem is coming from, or try different debugging techniques; they post their question online and pray for someone to hand over answers. However, I learned from an [essay](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) written by Eric Raymond that many developers will skip over the question, and not take the time to read, or answer, if the poster has not put in effort to find the answer on their own first. Raymond’s essay sheds a slightly harsh, but insightful perspective on the etiquette that is required to receive positive and helpful feedback when interacting with other developers online. Open-ended questions that can easily be answered from a quick google search may receive answers that the poster was not looking for. For example, one user asked [what the difference is between JavaScript and Java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/245062/whats-the-difference-between-javascript-and-java). A simple question, but one that did not need to be answered on a public forum. The question received many sarcastic answers such as “[They’re] similar like Car and Carpet are similar,” and one response even linked a Wikipedia page. The question asked was not dumb, but it could have easily been answered by putting in the time to read a couple articles online.


## How to Ask the Right Questions

A smart question will provide the right amount of background information, maybe a snippet of code, and the different methods that were used but did not solve the problem. This type of question provides enough context for a developer to understand the problem, and quickly respond in a constructive way without wasting anyone’s time. One developer on StackOverflow provided what he was attempting to do and a piece of the code that was returning a default value. He ended the post by restating his question in a concise manner: [“How do I successfully query the checked property?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/901712/how-do-i-check-whether-a-checkbox-is-checked-in-jquery) By the responses, you can tell that the online community responds kindly to such wonderfully posed questions. Many developers modified the provided code, but some also offered simpler ways to query the checked property. It is clear that software engineers often rely on the internet to either find out the difference between two languages, or ask for help in solving a bug. The trick to being successful is to learn the appropriate places and ways to ask for help.
